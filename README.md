Do not mistake JS as its own project because JS is for the scripts of html, CSS is for the styles for html.
If the project contains more than 2 HTML's, then JS will be written in the html itsself.
Some css files will have image urls, particularly because i made and practiced them in VS code, so you can put your own pictures
